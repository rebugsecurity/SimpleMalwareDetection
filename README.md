# SimpleMalwareDetection
This script is made for detecting and attempting to avoid any malware found in directories that the end-user has provided. It can take the hash of any known malware of your choosing and it will test the directory path that you give it, and it will check it for that specific malware or any other malware. I hope you all enjoy this program!

# Installing basic requirements.
